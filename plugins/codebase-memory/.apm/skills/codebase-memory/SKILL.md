description: "Install, update, and integrate codebase-memory-mcp (CBM), a local knowledge-graph server for codebases. USE FOR: checking CBM installation and index readiness; installing or updating the binary; configuring its CLI/MCP workflows in agents, skills, prompts, and subagents. DO NOT USE FOR: exploring code with graph queries; use codebase-memory-exploration. For the visual UI use codebase-memory-lens; for affected-test selection use codebase-memory-test-impact."

# codebase-memory-mcp (CBM)

CBM indexes code, documentation, and supported infrastructure into a local graph. Queries and bundled semantic search run locally and need no hosted service, model, or API key. The optional Lens browser chat is separate.
